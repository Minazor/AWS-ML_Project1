Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

        ResNet: golden retriever
        AlexNet: golden retriever
        VGG: golden retriever
        All three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg as the same breed: "golden retriever".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
    ResNet:
        Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever
        Dog_02.jpg: golden retriever
    AlexNet:
        Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever
        Dog_02.jpg: golden retriever
    VGG:
        Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever
        Dog_02.jpg: blenheim spaniel
    ResNet and AlexNet classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed (golden retriever). However, VGG classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever and Dog_02.jpg as blenheim spaniel.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
    Banana_01.jpg:
        ResNet: banana (correctly classified as not a dog)
        AlexNet: banana (correctly classified as not a dog)
        VGG: banana (correctly classified as not a dog)
    Frog_01.jpg:
        ResNet: tree frog, tree-frog (correctly classified as not a dog)
        AlexNet: tree frog, tree-frog (correctly classified as not a dog)
        VGG: tree frog, tree-frog (correctly classified as not a dog)
    All three model architectures correctly classified Banana_01.jpg and Frog_01.jpg as not being dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
    ResNet and AlexNet both consistently classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed (golden retriever), demonstrating consistent breed classification. Additionally, they correctly identified Banana_01.jpg and Frog_01.jpg as not being dogs. VGG, on the other hand, misclassified Dog_02.jpg as a blenheim spaniel, showing inconsistency in breed classification.
    Therefore, based on the classification consistency and accuracy across all images, ResNet and AlexNet performed equally well and are selected as the best model architectures for classifying the four uploaded images. They both provided consistent and accurate classifications without any misclassifications.
